Web Placement Portal Summary
Overview: The Web Placement Portal is designed with two distinct sub-portals for students and administrators to manage the placement process effectively.

Administrator Portal:

Company Management: Admins can add new companies for placement registration, specifying details such as eligibility criteria (CGPA, courses, etc.) and registration deadlines. Admins can also view, edit, and manage all listed companies.
Student Management: Admins can view all registered students and apply or remove red flags based on policy breaches. They can also filter and fetch student details.
Placement Status: Admins can update and manage the placement status of students, tracking their placement progress with various companies.
Student Portal:

Profile Management: Students can update their personal details upon account creation. After a set period, further updates are restricted.
Company Listings: Students can view a list of companies added by the admin. They can register for companies based on eligibility criteria.
Placement Confirmation: Students can confirm their placements once the admin updates their placement status.
This portal streamlines the placement process by facilitating efficient management for admins and providing a user-friendly experience for students.
